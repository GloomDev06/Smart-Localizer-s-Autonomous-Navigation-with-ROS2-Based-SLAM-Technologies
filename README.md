# Smart-Localizer-s-Autonomous-Navigation-with-ROS2-Based-SLAM-Technologies

Over the past decade, robots have revolutionized industrial operations by reducing the need for human labor. Our project introduces the “Smart Localizer,” an autonomous robot that utilizes advanced Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, making it especially useful in small regions where GPS is ineffective. By employing the Nav2 Stack, Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL), and SLAM in ROS2, the robot integrates 2D LiDAR and SLAM methods to address GPS limitations in confined spaces. This innovation enables precise mapping and localization, pioneering autonomous navigation without human intervention. The Smart Localizer enhances efficiency and safety in industrial applications, contributing to the advancement of autonomous industrial robots by overcoming spatial constraints with cutting-edge technology.
